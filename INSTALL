Welcome to MPlayer OS X, The Movie Player for Mac OS X.

This application is a Mac OS X-specific version of MPlayer, so you may
want to read the accompanying README.mplayer.txt document.

This document is for getting you started in a few minutes building
from source code. It does not attempt to explain the usage of the
application as the included help files exist for that purpose.  It
cannot answer all of your questions. If you have problems, please
read the documentation in DOCS/HTML/en/index.html, which should help
you solve most of your problems.  Also read the man page to learn
how to use MPlayer.


Requirements:
- You need a Mac running Mac OS 10.4 or better (XCode project 
is not working under XCode 1.5)
- You need the XCode 2.x development environment (available at
  http://developer.apple.com)
- Experience with the Mac OS X Terminal environment

STEP0: Getting MPlayer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Binary versions of the Official releases, prereleases and SVN snapshots,
as well as fonts for the OSD and codec packages are available from the
download section of our homepage at

  http://www.mplayerhq.hu/homepage/dload.html

To build MPlayer from source code, you must first open up Terminal, 
select and navigate to your base build directory and checkout the latest
sources from CVS (you will require both the main and mplayerosx
modules):

  svn checkout svn://svn.mplayerhq.hu/mplayer/trunk/ main
  svn checkout svn://svn.mplayerhq.hu/mplayerosx/trunk/ mplayerosx

Directories named 'main' and 'mplayerosx' will be created.


__________________________
STEP1: Configuring MPlayer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first step is to set the target OS version to '10.3' in the environment
variable MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET.  If you use the bash shell (or a
variant), the command should look like this

  export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.3


________________________
STEP2: Compiling MPlayer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now you can start the compilation by navigating to 'mplayerosx' (if you
are not already there) and executing:

  make mplayer

When this completes, still in 'mplayerosx' execute:

  make
  make dist


____________________________________________
STEP3: Installing and Using the Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Step 4 should have yielded a compressed, mountable archive (.dmg).  At
this point, it will be simplest to switch to the Finder and navigate
to the 'mplayerosx' directory.  Double-click the .dmg to mount it and
double-click the MPlayer OS X Installer and follow the instructions on
screen to complete the installation.  Finally, navigate to the
Applications folder and double-click it there to run it.

Any further questions you may have are probably answered in the rest of
the documentation.  The places to start reading are the man page,
DOCS/HTML/en/index.html and DOCS/HTML/en/faq.html. If you find a bug,
please report it, but first read DOCS/HTML/en/bugreports.html.
