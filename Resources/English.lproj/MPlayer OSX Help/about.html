			<h5>About The MPlayer Project</h5>
			<p1>
			MPlayer is a multimedia player for Linux (runs on many other platforms and CPU architectures, see the documentation). It plays most 
			MPEG/VOB, AVI, ASF/WMA/WMV, RM, QT/MOV/MP4, OGG/OGM, MKV, VIVO, FLI, NuppelVideo, yuv4mpeg, FILM and RoQ files, supported by many native 
			and binary codecs. You can watch VideoCD, SVCD, DVD, 3ivx and DivX 3/4/5 movies, too.
			</p1>
			<br/>
			<p1>
			MPlayer is <b>fast</b>, as most of time-critical parts are optimized for Intel/AMD (MMX/MMX2/SSE/SSE2/3DNow!/3DNowEx),
			PowerPC G4 (Altivec), SPARC (VIS), ARM PDAs and the Sony Playstation 2.

			<h5>About MPlayer OSX</h5>
			<p1>
			MPlayer OSX was originally developed by Klokan Petr Pridal, who was also the founder of the project, and Jan Devera. Now, the
			Project is being actively developed by Nicolas Plourde and a small team of volunteers. It has undergone some changes in the
			user interface, gained on speed, and is aiming to be the best movie player for the mac.
